Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as an accountant, but I strive to improve my skills in the field of Data Analytics through appropriate on-the-job training and retraining in order to make an effective contribution to the work of the organization.
I am passionate about data analysis and solving complex problems. Knowledge of accounting methods and principles is my advantage when developing analytical models, especially in financial or business analysis. Knowledge of tools such as SQL and Python allows me to effectively process and analyze complex data sets, and Tableau and Power BI allow me to collect and analyze data from various sources, creating an environment for making informed decisions in the organization. Ability to conduct A/B testing ensures that data-driven hypotheses are tested, resulting in improved products, services, and marketing strategies.
